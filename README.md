# Quadruped_Locomotion_Model_Based_DRL
This repository contains implementation of Quadrupedal locomotion from formulation of kinematics and dynamics to deploying it on an actual robot. The robot we use is Unitree Go1 Edu, a low cost quadruped robot which is open source and can be deployed both, using python APIs and ROS.

This repo is under active development.
